** TODO find the datasets
*** choice 1: passwd
-- expect passwd we can also explore the username, the webpage, etc.
-- if we are able to get facebook data (eg. networks) or some data
   like online shopping things would be more fun and the data set is
   not that big
-- Hard things:
1. might learning LDA and generating function
2. how to deal with the string
3. how to transfer our model to recommender systems (like what kinds
   of password we recommend to use) 也就是说当用户输入了密码之后我们能
   检验出他这个密码是否容易被识别，怎么判断这个呢？可以从大量的数据中
   识别一些常用的密码，黑客攻击时候经常采用撞库。because of this, we
   think about how to avoid this situation from what we learned. like
   generate the passwd??

4. how to 

*** choice 2: Detecting Malicious URL
-- mainly for classification: 1 means a malicious URL and 0 indicates
a benign URL.
-- benefits: we have enough data to deal with


*** TODO make an agreement of model choosing
-- Our choices: LDA, Bag of words, Recommender systems

** TODO learn how to modeling

** TODO Writing analysing stuff
