# Install requirements

All the requirements are in requirements.txt file, you can either use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the package installed or do some set up things as follows:

## Set up

If you have Jupyter in your requirements.txt and you activate that environment (I recommend Virtualenv), install, and run Jupyter, you'll have all the specific versions you want. So:

     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate #(different command on Windows)
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     jupyter notebook
## Requirement
     pip install -r requirements.txt
