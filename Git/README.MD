## From: https://youtu.be/I8gZlctY5no
After installing git, we are able to upload it by terminal command.
### Git clone
Firstly, create a respositories and clone it by using `git clone https://yourgitaddress`
### Coding
After that, you are able to change the local files and enjoying your coding.
### Update the files
In order to update files, we should do as follows:<br>
1. `git add --all`<br>
2. `git commit -m "information"`<br>
(skip: look at your status by using `git status`)<br>
3. `git push` to push the files (need to login in at the first time).<br>
4. if you fail to upload the codes, try to update your version of the code first by using `git pull --rebase`
